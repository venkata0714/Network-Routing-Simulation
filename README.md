# Network Routing Simulation: Exploration of Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford and A* Algorithm for Optimal Routing 


The methodology involves developing a network routing simulator using Python and NetworkX library. We design a network topology with nodes as routers and edges as connections. We implement Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, and A* algorithms for routing. We define performance metrics such as routing efficiency and computational complexity. We conduct experiments varying network parameters and analyze results. We visualize the network and shortest paths using Matplotlib.
